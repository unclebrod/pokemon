Many abilities act as a power-up by increasing a move or stat; others introduce a third-party effect like a weather condition. Some abilities can even hinder a Pok\u00e9mon battle.\n Each Pok\u00e9mon can have only one ability, however, some have the option of two different abilities. The choice is random and each ability is equally likely. There are 308 single-ability Pok\u00e9mon and 355 dual-ability Pok\u00e9mon.\n In Pok\u00e9mon Black &amp; White, a third hidden ability was introduced.
